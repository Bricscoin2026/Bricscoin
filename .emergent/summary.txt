<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user requested to create a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency named BricsCoin. The project has since evolved into a full-stack application with a web and desktop wallet, hardware mining support, and deployment to a custom domain () on the user's Hetzner server.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Blockchain Core:** Proof of Work (PoW) consensus with a Bitcoin-style difficulty system (retargeting every 2016 blocks), SHA256 hashing, 21,000,000 total supply, and a block reward halving mechanism.
- **Transactions:** A fee of 0.05 BRICS per transaction. Transactions must appear instant to the user, with balances updating immediately upon submission.
- **Mining:** Support for hardware ASIC miners (Bitaxe, Nerdminer) via a Bitcoin-compliant Stratum protocol, accessible at .
- **Wallets:** A secure web wallet and a BricsCoin Core desktop wallet (for Windows, macOS, Linux) that perform client-side transaction signing.
- **Source Code & Transparency:** The project must be 100% open-source and publicly available on GitHub. A whitepaper, team information (founder Jabo86), and a transparent breakdown of the 1,000,000 BRICS premine must be on the website.
- **Credibility:** The project must address red flags to appear legitimate, including having a public codebase, a clear roadmap, reasonable chain parameters, and community links (Twitter/X).

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
The project is functionally complete and feature-rich, but the latest version is **not yet live on the production domain**.
- **Codebase:** All source code for the backend, frontend, stratum server, and desktop wallet is complete and has been pushed to the user's public GitHub repository: .
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application with a Bitcoin-style difficulty system (initial difficulty 1000), a 0.05 BRICS transaction fee, and an instant confirmation mechanism for transactions. It includes a  endpoint for transparency.
- **Frontend:** A React web app with all UI elements updated to reflect the new difficulty, fees, and community links. It clearly states that ASIC hardware is required for mining and provides links to download wallets from GitHub releases. All references to Emergent have been removed.
- **Desktop Wallet:** The BricsCoin Core (v2.1) Electron wallet has been updated with P2P logic and secure client-side signing. A GitHub Actions workflow successfully builds binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux, which are available on the GitHub repository's Releases page.
- **Domain & DNS:** The user's domains  and  are correctly configured on Cloudflare to point to the Hetzner server IP () with the proxy disabled (DNS only), making them ready for the Stratum server and web traffic.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user was struggling to update the production server on Hetzner with the latest code from GitHub. The agent was guiding the user through SSH commands on their Android device (Termux) and PC to perform the deployment. The final step is for the user to successfully run the deployment command.
- Status: BLOCKED
- Agent Testing Done: Y
- Which testing method agent to use? Manual testing by user. The user needs to execute SSH commands on their production server.
- User Testing Done: N

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system., , , , and  command variations to the user, who was trying to execute them from an Android device. The user encountered issues with permissions, file paths, and corrupted downloads.
    - Next debug checklist: The agent has provided a final, single, comprehensive command to be run from a PC (Mac/Windows/Linux) terminal. The next agent must guide the user to execute this command and verify its success.
        **Command for user:**
        
        (Password: )
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is the final step required to launch the project. It will update the live website () with all the requested features, bug fixes, and credibility improvements, while preserving the existing blockchain data.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? Y
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both. After deployment, the agent and user must visit  to confirm all changes are live (e.g., difficulty is 1000, transaction fees are present, UI text is updated).
    - Blocked on other issue: User action.

**In progress Task List**:
- None. All development tasks are complete pending the final deployment.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Enhancements (Post-Launch):**
    - Pursue exchange listings.
    - Develop a mobile wallet for iOS/Android.
    - Create a dedicated page for community mining pools.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Credibility Overhaul:**
    - **Open Source:** Guided user to create a new GitHub account and successfully pushed the entire project, making it public.
    - **Whitepaper & About Page:** Created a  and a new About page on the site with a roadmap, founder info (Jabo86), and technical specifications.
    - **Premine Transparency:** Implemented a  endpoint and updated the About page to show a live, transparent breakdown of the token supply, including the 1M premine.
    - **UI/UX Polish:** Removed all misleading Start Mining text, clarifying that ASIC hardware is required. Removed all branding/references to Emergent. Added favicon and Twitter/X profile links.
- **Blockchain Core Upgrade:**
    - **Bitcoin-style Difficulty:** Replaced the simple leading zeros system with a robust, scalable Bitcoin-style target-based difficulty, set to .
    - **Difficulty Adjustment:** Implemented the Bitcoin algorithm to automatically adjust difficulty every 2016 blocks.
    - **Transaction Fees:** Added a 0.05 BRICS fee to all transactions.
    - **Instant Transactions:** Modified the backend to immediately confirm transactions and update balances to meet the user's UX requirements.
- **Wallet and Deployment Pipeline:**
    - **GitHub Actions:** Created and debugged a CI/CD workflow () to automatically build the BricsCoin Core desktop wallet for Windows (.exe), macOS (.zip), and Linux (.AppImage).
    - **Wallet Releases:** The wallet binaries were successfully built and are available on the project's GitHub Releases page.
    - **Site Downloads Page:** Updated the Downloads page to link directly to the GitHub releases for all platforms.
- **Production Server Configuration:**
    - **DNS Setup:** Guided user to correctly configure  and  on Cloudflare.
    - **Stratum URL Update:** Updated all references in the frontend and documentation to use .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All issues from the previous handoff and raised during this session have been resolved, pending the final deployment.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Hetzner Server Instability:** This remains a low-level risk. The server's 2GB RAM can be stressed by  operations. This is a hardware limitation on the user's end.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Bitcoin-style Difficulty:** The system now uses  for block validation, allowing for much greater difficulty scaling.
- **Bitcoin-style Difficulty Adjustment:** The difficulty automatically retargets every 2016 blocks based on the actual time taken, aiming for a 10-minute block time.
- **Instant Confirmation (UX Choice):** Transactions are marked  on submission, a centralized shortcut to provide the instant feel requested by the user.
- **GitHub Actions for Electron Build:** The  file automates the creation of cross-platform desktop applications.

**key DB schema**
- : 

**changes in tech stack**
- No new technologies were added, but the use of  and GitHub Actions became a core part of the development workflow.

**All files of reference**
- : The heart of the blockchain logic. Contains all recent changes to difficulty, fees, and transaction confirmation.
- : New page central to the project's credibility, showing tokenomics and roadmap.
- : Defines the automated wallet build process.
- : The official project document created to enhance legitimacy.
- : Contains configuration critical for the successful build of the desktop wallet.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The instant transaction feature is a centralized implementation to satisfy a UX request. If the user desires true decentralization in the future, this logic would need to be refactored to rely solely on block confirmations.

**key api endpoints**
- **New:** : Provides transparent data on supply, premine, and circulating coins.
- **Modified:** : Now handles a  fee and confirms transactions instantly.
- **Stratum:** 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your ONLY task is deployment support.** All development is complete. The user is blocked on updating their live server ( on Hetzner). You must guide them to run the final SSH command.
- **Do NOT confuse the environments.** The Emergent preview URL shows the correct, updated site. The user's production domain, , points to a separate Hetzner server and shows the old, broken site. Do not suggest linking the domain to Emergent, as this will cause them to lose their real blockchain data.
- **The user operates from a mobile device.** Instructions must be simple, clear, and easy to copy-paste into a mobile SSH client like Termux. Be patient, as this is a difficult environment for the user to work in.
- **The project is considered Ready to Launch.** Once the deployment is complete, the user's goal is achieved. Your final interaction should be confirming the successful deployment and congratulating them on the launch.
