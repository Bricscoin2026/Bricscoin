<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user requested to create a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency named BricsCoin. The project has since evolved based on user feedback.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Blockchain Core:** Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, SHA256 hashing algorithm, a total supply of 21,000,000 coins, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and a block reward halving mechanism.
- **Decentralization:** The network must be fully decentralized. Initially, this was a seed-node model, but the user has now requested a BricsCoin Core style desktop wallet that functions as a full node, stores the blockchain locally, and participates in the P2P network, ensuring the blockchain survives even if the main server goes offline.
- **Mining:** Support for both browser-based mining (in a background web worker) and hardware mining via ASICs (e.g., Bitaxe, Nerdminer) through the Stratum protocol.
- **Wallet:**
    - A web wallet integrated into the main site.
    - A new BricsCoin Core full-node desktop wallet for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    - Wallets must support creation, sending/receiving, and recovery via a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase (BIP39).
- **Premine:** A one-time premine of 1,000,000 BRICS to a user-specified address was requested and completed.
- **Deployment & Domain:** The web application and seed node are deployed on the user's Hetzner server and accessible via the domain . The Stratum server should be accessible via a subdomain.
- **UI/UX:** The website must have a Matrix style animated background, use the user-provided coin logo (without a white square), and be fully multilingual (Italian and English implemented so far).
- **Source Code:** The project's source code should be publicly available on GitHub (currently blocked).
- **Documentation:** The site must include a Run a Node page with instructions and a guide for setting up Stratum mining.

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack BricsCoin application is deployed and running on the user's Hetzner server (), accessible via  and the official domain .
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application serves the main API, P2P node communication, and file downloads. It uses MongoDB as its database. It has been updated to support BIP39 mnemonic seed phrases for wallet creation and import. A premine transaction of 1,000,000 BRICS has been added to the genesis block.
- **Frontend:** A React web app with a Matrix background and updated logo. It includes a dashboard, explorer, web wallet, background browser mining, a downloads page, and a Run a Node guide. It is partially multilingual (EN/IT).
- **Stratum Server:** A Python server handles ASIC miner connections. It has been significantly improved for compatibility with NerdMiners, handling variable difficulty and malformed requests.
- **Domain:** The domain  is configured via Cloudflare (in Flexible SSL mode) to point to the Hetzner server. Nginx is set up as a reverse proxy.
- **BricsCoin Core Project:** A new project for a full-node desktop wallet () has been scaffolded with Electron and NeDB, but contains no functional logic yet.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Scaffolding the new **BricsCoin Core** desktop wallet application to fulfill the user's request for true decentralization. The agent created the project structure, , installed initial dependencies (, ), and created placeholder files for the main process (), blockchain logic (), preload script (), and UI ().
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? This is a large feature. After building the core functionalities (wallet creation, DB storage, P2P sync), the  will be required to build and test the application on different platforms.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: GitHub Account Suspended (P0)
- Issue 2: Mac Wallet Build is Incomplete (P1)
- Issue 3: Windows Wallet Build is not a proper installer (P2)
- Issue 4: NerdMiner mining not fully functional (P1)
- Issue 5: Web miner fails to submit found blocks (P2)
- Issue 6: Stratum server not configured with domain name (P2)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes: Push attempts fail with a 403 error. Agent confirmed with the user that the account is suspended.
    - Next debug checklist: Ask the user for an update on their GitHub account status. If unresolved, request a new GitHub account and Personal Access Token.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Critical blocker for source code backup, community collaboration, and automated CI/CD builds for desktop wallets.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? Y
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: User action.

- Issue 2 & 3:
    - Attempted fixes: Workarounds (zipped source/unpacked folder) were provided. Proper builds require native OS environments.
    - Next debug checklist: Implement a GitHub Actions workflow () using  and  runners once the GitHub issue is resolved.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Provide standard, user-friendly installers for Mac (.dmg) and Windows (.exe).
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: Issue 1: GitHub Account Suspended.

- Issue 4:
    - Attempted fixes: The Stratum server was heavily refactored to support  and handle malformed data. The agent confirmed the NerdMiner connects and has its difficulty set, but the user reports hashrate remains at 0.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Add extensive logging to the  function in  to inspect the exact shares being received from the NerdMiner.
        - Verify the job format sent by  is fully compatible with NerdMiner firmware.
        - Temporarily lower the main blockchain difficulty in  to 1 to see if a block can be found.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Enables hardware mining, a key requirement for the project's legitimacy and network security.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Is recurring issue? Y
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? backend

- Issue 5:
    - Attempted fixes: None. The issue was observed in logs () after the web worker found a valid hash.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Check the browser console logs on the mining page when a block is found.
        - Inspect the  function in  and the data format it sends.
        - Compare this payload with the expected format in the  endpoint in . The issue is likely a data mismatch.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Allows users to contribute to the network and earn rewards via browser mining.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both

- Issue 6:
    - Attempted fixes: None.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Instruct the user to add a new A record in their Cloudflare DNS settings for the subdomain .
        - The record must point to the Hetzner IP .
        - The Proxy status (orange cloud) for this specific record MUST be set to DNS only (grey cloud), as Cloudflare proxy does not support the TCP protocol used by Stratum.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Provides a user-friendly, branded endpoint for miners instead of a raw IP address.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Implement BricsCoin Core (Full-Node Desktop Wallet) (P0)
    - Where to resume: The project is scaffolded at . The next steps are to build out the core logic:
        1.  In : Implement blockchain logic using  for local file-based storage of blocks and transactions.
        2.  In : Create Electron IPC handlers for UI actions (create wallet, get balance, send transaction, get sync status).
        3.  In  and a new : Build the user interface to interact with the main process via the  bridge.
        4.  Implement P2P logic for discovering peers and synchronizing the blockchain with other nodes.
    - What will be achieved with this?: A standalone, resilient desktop wallet that makes the BricsCoin network truly decentralized, addressing the user's core request.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both
    - Blocked on something: No.
