<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user requested to create a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency named BricsCoin. The project has since evolved based on user feedback.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Blockchain Core:** Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, SHA256 hashing algorithm, a total supply of 21,000,000 coins, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and a block reward halving mechanism.
- **Decentralization & BricsCoin Core:** The network must be fully decentralized. The primary method for this is a BricsCoin Core style desktop wallet that functions as a client to the main blockchain, allowing users to mine and transact on the real network from their desktop.
- **Mining:** Support for both browser-based mining and hardware mining via ASICs (e.g., Bitaxe, Nerdminer) through the Stratum protocol.
- **Wallet:** A web wallet integrated into the main site and the BricsCoin Core desktop wallet. Wallets must support creation, sending/receiving transactions. The web wallet supports recovery via a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase.
- **Premine:** A one-time premine of 1,000,000 BRICS to a genesis address was completed.
- **Deployment & Domain:** The web application and node are deployed on the user's Hetzner server and accessible via the domain .
- **UI/UX:** The website has a Matrix style animated background and uses a user-provided coin logo. The site is now English-only per user request. The BricsCoin Core UI is under development.
- **Source Code:** The project's source code should be available for download from the website.

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack BricsCoin application is deployed on a Hetzner server (), accessible via .
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application serving the main API, P2P endpoints for the Core wallet, and file downloads. It uses MongoDB for storage.
- **Frontend:** A React web app (now English-only) with a dashboard, explorer, web wallet, and background browser mining.
- **Stratum Server:** A Python server for ASIC miner connections.
- **BricsCoin Core Project:** A new, functional Electron-based desktop wallet project located at . It has been rebuilt from scratch multiple times to resolve user-side execution issues. The current version acts as a light client, connecting directly to the  API for all blockchain operations (syncing, mining, transactions), ensuring it operates on the main network. The user has confirmed that wallet creation now works. The source code is available for download on the website.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user confirmed the basic functionality of the BricsCoin Core wallet is working. The new request is to improve its UI/UX. The agent began by scaffolding a new, more visually appealing  with improved styling and placeholders for a logo and a stop mining button.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? The agent cannot run the Electron app. The next step is to package the new version, upload it, and ask the user to test it on their Mac. Debugging will rely on user-provided screenshots of the DevTools console.
- User Testing Done: N (for the new UI)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: BricsCoin Core UI/UX Improvements (P0)
- Issue 2: Hetzner Server is Unstable (P1)
- Issue 3: GitHub Account Suspended (P1)
- Issue 4: NerdMiner mining not fully functional (P1)
- Issue 5: Mac/Windows Wallet native builds are Incomplete (P2)
- Issue 6: Web miner may not submit found blocks (P2)

    - Attempted fixes: Agent created a new  with a better layout and styling.
    - Next debug checklist:
        1. Implement the Stop Mining button functionality in  and .
        2. Add the BricsCoin logo to the UI.
        3. Package the updated  source code.

    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: Issue 3: GitHub Account Suspended.

    - **P2: Fix Web Miner Block Submission**: Debug the  error to make web mining functional.
    - **P2: Configure Stratum Subdomain**: Guide the user to set up .
- **Future Tasks:**

    - **P1: Finalize GitHub Actions**: Automate wallet builds once the GitHub account is restored.
    - **P2: Create a Landing Page:** Design a dedicated landing page to promote BricsCoin.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Fixed Circulating Supply:** Corrected the supply calculation on the backend to include the 1M premine and deployed the fix to the live server.
- **Updated Web Dashboard:** Added a Remaining to Mine card and deployed the change.
- **Stabilized Hetzner Deployment:** Diagnosed and guided the user through fixing a server crash due to low memory. Implemented a safer, sequential build process to prevent recurrence.
- **Made Website English-Only:** Removed the multilingual framework and hardcoded all text to English as requested by the user.
- **Fixed Broken Web Pages:** Repaired the  and  pages, which were blank due to leftover multilingual code.
- **Improved Web Wallet UI:** Added the user's available balance to the Send dialog.
- **Rebuilt & Fixed BricsCoin Core:** Went through multiple iterations to create a functional desktop wallet, resolving user-side compilation and execution errors by switching to  and a light-client architecture. The user has confirmed the latest version starts and can create a wallet.
- **Cleaned Downloads Page:** Removed old, non-functional wallet files from the server, leaving only the new BricsCoin Core source and the main project source code.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **NerdMiner mining not fully functional**: User reports hashrate at 0.
- **Web miner fails to submit found blocks**:  error was not investigated.
- **Stratum server not configured with domain name**: No action was taken.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Web Workers
- **Desktop Wallet:** Electron,  for local data. It functions as a light client that communicates with the main FastAPI backend for all blockchain operations.
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Cloudflare. The server has limited memory, requiring careful, sequential deployments.

**key DB schema**

**changes in tech stack**
- **Desktop Wallet:** The  project was completely rebuilt. It no longer uses  or . It now uses  for simple key-value storage, significantly reducing dependencies and resolving cross-platform compilation issues.
- **Frontend:** The  and associated libraries for multilingual support have been removed. The application is now hardcoded in English.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated circulating supply logic.
- : UI updated for remaining supply, translations removed.
- : UI updated to show balance on send, translations removed.
- : UI updated for new file list, translations removed.
- : Fixed blank page error, translations removed.
- : Fixed blank page error, translations removed.
- : Removed .
- : Removed language switcher.
- : Rewritten multiple times. Current version uses  and fetches all data from the main server API.
- : Rewritten multiple times. Contains all UI and client-side logic for the desktop app.
- : Dependencies simplified to  and .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the desktop UI. As features are added, it should be broken into separate files for better maintainability.
- The web frontend pages now contain hardcoded English strings. While this was a direct user request, it moves away from a scalable localization strategy.

**key api endpoints**
- **Used by BricsCoin Core:**
  - 
  - 
  - 
  -  (used by the core wallet to submit blocks)
  -  (used by the core wallet to send transactions)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Hetzner Server is Unstable:** The server (CPX11, 2GB RAM) is under-powered. Docker builds, especially for the frontend, can exhaust memory and crash the database or the entire server. Deployments must be done carefully, one service at a time ().
- **BricsCoin Core is a Light Client:** The desktop wallet does **not** store the blockchain locally. It is fully dependent on the  API for all its data and operations. This was a deliberate design choice to simplify development and ensure it works on the real network. Do not attempt to add local blockchain storage logic.
- **BricsCoin Core Development Cycle:** The agent cannot run Electron. The workflow is: 1. Code changes. 2. Create  archive. 3. Upload to server. 4. Ask user to download and test on their Mac. 5. Debug using user-provided screenshots of the DevTools console ().
- **GitHub is Blocked:** All usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
