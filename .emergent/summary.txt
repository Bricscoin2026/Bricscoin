<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user requested to create a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency named BricsCoin.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Blockchain Core:** Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, SHA256 hashing algorithm, a total supply of 21,000,000 coins, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and a block reward halving mechanism similar to Bitcoin.
- **Decentralization:** The network must be decentralized, allowing anyone in the world to run a node and participate in mining. A seed node system for P2P discovery is required.
- **Mining:** Support for both browser-based mining and hardware mining via ASICs (e.g., Bitaxe, Nerdminer) through the Stratum protocol.
- **Wallet:** An advanced, multi-platform wallet for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS to allow users to store, send, and receive BricsCoin. The wallets should be downloadable.
- **Deployment:** The entire application (web app, API, Stratum server) should be deployed on the user's Hetzner server.
- **Source Code:** The project's source code should be publicly available on the user's GitHub repository.
- **Documentation:** A multilingual how-to guide (Italian, English, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish) explaining the project, how to get the code, and how to mine.

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack BricsCoin application is deployed and running on the user's Hetzner server (IP: ).
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application serves the main API, P2P node communication, and file downloads. It uses MongoDB as its database.
- **Frontend:** A React-based web application provides a dashboard, blockchain explorer, web wallet (as a PWA for mobile), and a browser-based mining interface.
- **Stratum Server:** A separate Python server handles connections from ASIC miners, enabling hardware-based mining.
- **Decentralization:** The Hetzner server is configured as the primary seed node. The repository contains a  file for other users to easily spin up their own nodes, which connect to the seed.
- **Wallets:** Executable wallets are available for download directly from the server's API:
    - Linux:  file.
    - Windows: A zipped folder of the unpacked application.
    - Mac: A zipped folder of the source code for manual execution.
- **Documentation:** A multilingual HTML page explaining the project has been created and is hosted on the server.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was creating an API endpoint () to serve the new multilingual documentation page () from the Hetzner server. The agent added the necessary code to  and uploaded the documentation file.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? backend testing agent. The agent must verify that the new endpoint is live and serves the correct content by executing a  command on the Hetzner server.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: GitHub Account Suspended (P0)
- Issue 2: Mac Wallet Build is Incomplete (P1)
- Issue 3: Windows Wallet Build is not a proper installer (P2)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent tried to push updates to the user's repository () but received a 403 Forbidden - account suspended error. The agent advised the user to contact GitHub support or use an alternative account.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Ask the user for an update on their GitHub account status.
        - If unresolved, ask the user to provide a new GitHub account and a Personal Access Token with  and  scopes.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a critical blocker. Fixing it will allow for proper source code management, version control, automated builds via GitHub Actions, and will make the project accessible to the community as requested.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? Y
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: Blocked on user action to resolve their GitHub account suspension.

- Issue 2:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent could not build a  file for macOS because the build environment is ARM-based Linux, and cross-compilation requires a native macOS environment. The workaround was to provide a zip file with the source code for users to build manually.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Once the GitHub issue is resolved, complete the  file to use a  runner to build the  file automatically.
        - Upload the resulting  file as a release artifact on GitHub.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: To provide a user-friendly, one-click installation experience for Mac users, as per the original request.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: Issue 1: GitHub Account Suspended

- Issue 3:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent failed to build a proper  installer on the Hetzner (x86 Linux) server due to issues with Wine. The workaround was to zip the  folder.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Once the GitHub issue is resolved, update the  to use a  runner to build a proper  installer.
        - Upload the  as a release artifact.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: To provide a standard and trusted installer for Windows users.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
    - Blocked on other issue: Issue 1: GitHub Account Suspended

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Finalize and Verify the Multilingual Documentation (P0)
    - Where to resume: The agent added the  endpoint to . The next step is to rebuild and restart the  Docker container on the Hetzner server to apply the changes.
    - What will be achieved with this?: It will make the user-requested multilingual documentation accessible to everyone via a direct URL.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? backend
    - Blocked on something: No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P0: Test P2P Synchronization:** Verify that the decentralization works as intended by simulating a new user running a node. This involves cloning the repo on a separate environment, running , and checking if the new node successfully connects to the seed node and syncs the blockchain.
    - **P1: Create a Downloads Page:** Add a new page to the frontend that fetches the list of available wallet files from the  endpoint and displays them with user-friendly download links.

- **Future Tasks:**
    - **P1: Implement GitHub Actions:** Once the GitHub account is restored, finalize the  workflow to automate the build and release of wallets for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    - **P2: Create a Landing Page:** As suggested by the agent, create a dedicated landing page to promote BricsCoin and onboard new users.
    - **P2: Refactor Deployment:** Improve the Hetzner deployment scripts for better error handling and robustness.

**All files of reference**
- : Core logic for API, P2P, and file downloads.
- : Logic for ASIC mining connections.
- : Defines all services for the main Hetzner deployment.
- : Simplified compose file for community nodes.
- : Contains scripts to build the desktop wallets.

**Areas that need refactoring**
- The wallet build process is highly manual and brittle. It should be fully automated via GitHub Actions once the account issue is resolved.
- The file download logic in  and the file serving setup on the Hetzner server were implemented through trial and error. This could be streamlined and made more robust.

**key api endpoints**
- : Get blockchain stats.
- : Get the full blockchain.
- : Mine a new block.
- : Create a new transaction.
- : Get list of peer nodes.
- : List available wallet downloads.
- : Download a specific wallet file.
- : View the multilingual documentation.
- : Stratum server for ASIC miners.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **DO NOT USE GITHUB:** The user's GitHub account () is suspended. All operations requiring  will fail. All work must be done directly on the Hetzner server until the user resolves this.
- **HETZNER SSH ACCESS:** The agent has root SSH access to the production server at . The password () was shared in the chat. Use  for scripted access.
- **WALLET BUILDS ARE MANUAL:** Wallet builds for Windows and Mac are problematic. The current builds are workarounds. A proper solution is blocked by the GitHub issue.
- **LIVE DEPLOYMENT:** The application is live and publicly accessible. Any changes made on the Hetzner server will affect real users immediately. Proceed with caution.
